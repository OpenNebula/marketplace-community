  OpenNebula Service used as part of the [toolkit-installer](https://github.com/6G-SANDBOX/toolkit-installer).
  This service automatically deploys and configures one MinIO VM, one Jenkins VM, and one TNLCM VM, all ready to be used in your 6G-Sandbox site.

  All multi-VM OpenNebula Services need to have running the following services:
    - [OneFlow](https://docs.opennebula.io/stable/management_and_operations/multivm_service_management/overview.html)
    - [OneGate](https://docs.opennebula.io/stable/management_and_operations/multivm_service_management/onegate_usage.html)

  See the dedicated [documentation](https://github.com/OpenNebula/one-apps/wiki).

  The 6G-Sandbox toolkit service makes use of these VM templates
  - [6G-Sandbox Jenkins](https://marketplace.mobilesandbox.cloud:9443/appliance/service_jenkins)
  - [6G-Sandbox TNLCM](https://marketplace.mobilesandbox.cloud:9443/appliance/service_TNLCM)
  - [Service MinIO](https://marketplace.opennebula.io/appliance/e2c4538a-1e7a-11ef-949c-97e1d7dcfb6f)
