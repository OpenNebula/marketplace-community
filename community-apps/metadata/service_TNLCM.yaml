  This appliance installs the latest version of [TNLCM](https://github.com/6G-SANDBOX/TNLCM) and [TNLCM_FRONTEND](https://github.com/6G-SANDBOX/TNLCM_FRONTEND) from the official repositories and configures them according to the input variables. Configuration of the TNLCM can be made when instanciating the VM.

  The image is based on an Ubuntu 24.04 cloud image with the OpenNebula [contextualization package](http://docs.opennebula.io/6.6/management_and_operations/references/kvm_contextualization.html).

  After deploying the appliance, check the status of the deployment in `/etc/one-appliance/status`, or deployment logs in `/var/log/one-appliance/`.

  The appliance configuration can be customized via parameters:

  * `ONEAPP_TNLCM_JENKINS_HOST` - IP address of the Jenkins server used to deploy the Trial Networks. Default `127.0.0.1`
  * `ONEAPP_TNLCM_JENKINS_USERNAME` - Username used to login into the Jenkins server to access and retrieve pipeline info. Default: `admin`
  * `ONEAPP_TNLCM_JENKINS_PASSWORD` - Password used to login into the Jenkins server to access and retrieve pipeline info.
  * `ONEAPP_TNLCM_JENKINS_TOKEN` - Token to authenticate while sending POST requests to the Jenkins Server API.
  * `ONEAPP_TNLCM_ADMIN_USER` - Name of the TNLCM admin user. Default: `tnlcm`
  * `ONEAPP_TNLCM_ADMIN_PASSWORD` - ONEAPP_TNLCM_ADMIN_PASSWORD: Password of the TNLCM admin user. Default: `tnlcm`
  * `ONEAPP_TNLCM_SITES_BRANCH` - Name of the branch IN 6G-Sandbox-Sites repository to deploy the trial networks.
  * `ONEAPP_TNLCM_DEPLOYMENT_SITE` - Name of directory in branch ONEAPP_TNLCM_SITES_BRANCH to deploy the trial networks.
  * `ONEAPP_TNLCM_DEPLOYMENT_SITE_TOKEN` - Token to encrypt and decrypt the 6G-Sandbox-Sites repository files for your site using Ansible Vault.

  **Note**: This appliance does not permit recontextualization. Modifying the context variables will not have any real efects on the running instance.
  
  **Note**: Remember to add a password variable in the template in order to have access to it, or make sure that your OpenNebula user has an SSH Public key preconfigured.

  **Note**: The TNLCM backend uses a MONGO database, so the VM needs to be virtualized with a CPU model that supports AVX instructions. The default CPU model in the template is host_passthrough, but if you are interested in VM live migration,
  change it to a CPU model similar to your host's CPU that supports [x86-64v2 or higher](https://www.qemu.org/docs/master/system/qemu-cpu-models.html).
